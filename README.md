## Reinforcement Learning in Maze Environment

### Overview
This Python notebook provides a simulation for studying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms within a maze-like environment. It includes a graphical representation to help visualize the agent's path through the maze, obstacles, and rewards.


### Features
- **Customizable Maze:** Define the maze shape, locations, obstacles, and rewards.
- **Visualization:** Utilize matplotlib for real-time visualization of the agent's movement within the maze.
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:** Implement RL algorithms to train an agent to navigate the maze (Generalised Policy Iteration ; Monte-Carlo ; TD-Temporal).

### Usage
1. **Set Up the Environment:** Configure the maze environment with obstacles and rewards.
2. **Initialize and Train Agent:** Employ RL algorithms to learn optimal navigation strategies.
3. **Visualize:** Observe the agent's behavior and learning progress through graphical outputs.
